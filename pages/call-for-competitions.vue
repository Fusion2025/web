          We are pleased to announce that FUSION 2025 will host competitions,
          consisting of a challenging information fusion problem that must be
          solved on a dataset or in a computational environment provided by the
          competition organizers based on a-priori-defined evaluation metrics or
          criteria.
        </p>
        <p class="page-content pt-4">
          Competitions have significantly spurred progress in related research
          fields, such as machine learning, by allowing researchers to focus on
          the algorithmic problem solution, relieving them from the upfront data
          collection task, and systematically assessing their solutions in a
          standardized, comparable, and clearly framed evaluation setting. For
          competition organizers, competitions offer a prime opportunity of
          attracting a vast talent pool to their problem to receive innovative,
          cutting-edge solutions. Hence, by introducing a dedicated competitions
          track, FUSION 2025 will provide a dedicated forum to bring together
          groups facing a challenging problem with the FUSION community’s
          creative innovation spirit and research expertise.
        </p>
        <p class="page-content pt-4">
          We are thus soliciting proposals for competitions, which should
          consist of a clearly defined problem statement requiring information
          fusion for its resolution. We explicitly encourage proposals across
          the whole spectrum of information fusion and application fields, from
          low-level fusion (e.g., tracking for autonomous vehicles or drones) to
          high-level fusion (e.g., human-in-the-loop fusion – incorporating
          human input and feedback into the fusion process, information fusion
          for decision support, natural language processing/soft fusion) and
          cross-cutting problems, as well as application-oriented problems
          (e.g., multi-modal information fusion for robotics).

          Competition organizers can propose their timelines for running their
          competition, but competitors should provide results by a date to be
          determined to impact the summary analysis paper. Please note that
          competition organizers must at least submit a paper — which will be
          peer-reviewed as any other — to the FUSION 2025 competitions track,
          which shall:

            presenting the problem, the provided dataset, the chosen evaluation
            metrics together with their rationale, and the eventual proposed
            “baseline” approach (or approaches), which defines the
            state-of-the-art performance that submitting teams seek to
            outperform;

          <li class="pt-2">
            2 - provide an analysis of the competition, e.g., how many

            results/achieved performance;

          Such summary analysis paper can be submitted with the joint authorship
          of all teams submitting a solution to the competition, or be not, as
          the organizers see fit. Teams submitting a solution to a competition
          are encouraged to submit a regular paper describing their approach to
          FUSION 2025. Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings. At
          least one of each paper’s authors will have to register and attend the
          conference in person.

          Successful competitions will be presented in a dedicated session at
          the conference, where the organizers will introduce the challenge and
          the teams will describe their solutions.
