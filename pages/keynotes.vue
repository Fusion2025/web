        <p>
          The talk explores the transformative potential of Tiny Machine
          Learning (TinyML) in enabling embedded artificial intelligence on
          resource-constrained devices. As an emerging field that brings machine
          learning capabilities to microcontrollers and low-power systems,
          TinyML offers solutions to critical challenges for IoT applications,
          such as bandwidth, latency, energy consumption, reliability, and
          privacy. The talk will highlight real-world implementations across
          agriculture, healthcare, industry, and environmental monitoring,
          demonstrating how these ultra-low-power AI systems can address
          pressing challenges in developing regions. Additionally, I will
          discuss our work with the TinyML4D academic network, a global
          initiative that makes TinyML education accessible to everyone,
          particularly in underserved communities, through open-source
          educational materials, training programs, and collaborative research
          opportunities that bridge the technological divide while fostering
          sustainable development.

          This talk presents research on data fusion applied to medical
          applications, particularly esophageal and breast cancer detection. We
          also evaluated combining classical and quantum data to enhance the
          diagnosis and build foundation models to expand knowledge in language
          and visual models. Ongoing research on data fusion applied to other
          areas will also be explored.

          This talk will begin with an overview of our team's previous activities in underwater/maritime robotics, mobile robotics, robots for topside inspection, manipulator robots, and aerial robotics. The main focus will be on an autonomous robotic system that integrates aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vehicles to detect oil leaks in offshore environments, using embedded sensors such as thermal cameras. This system is designed to execute autonomous trajectories and perform takeoff/landing operations on dynamic platforms like unmanned surface vehicles. Additionally, it collects meteorological and oceanographic data and applies AI algorithms for oil detection by combining remote sensing with local data. This integrated data can be used to enhance oil dispersion, atmospheric, and oceanographic models. Our team's control algorithms and technologies for tracking and landing can be adapted to various applications. Finally, we will briefly outline new projects under development and emerging research areas in the field of robotics.        </p>
