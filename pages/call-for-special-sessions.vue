          The FUSION 2025 Organizing Committee is welcoming proposals for
          Special Sessions on the theory and application of information fusion.
          The purpose of special sessions is to stimulate a focused discussion
          on new or innovative topics. Of particular interest are proposals that
          address “breaking news” research or topics different from traditional
          fusion-related topics. Organizers of accepted special sessions will be
          asked to chair the session and will be consulted when finalizing the
          list of papers in the session. Send your special session proposal to
          <NuxtLink to="mailto:fusion2025special@labnet.nce.ufrj.br"
            >fusion2025special@labnet.nce.ufrj.br</NuxtLink

          Each special session proposal should include an overview of the topic
          that identifies its relevance and introduces the papers to be
          presented. This description will be made available in the proceedings.
          Each proposal should also include a list of committed papers.

        <p class="page-content">
          Special session proposals will be evaluated based on the timeliness of
          the topic, relevance to the field of information fusion, number of
          potential papers (assessed from the list of committed papers), and the
          qualifications of the organizers. Once the proposal has been approved,
          it will be included among the sessions available for authors to submit
          their papers to. All papers submitted to a special session will be
          reviewed through the same review process as the regular papers of the
          conference to ensure that contributions are of high quality. If a
          special session has more papers accepted than the schedule can
          accommodate, some papers might be moved to other relevant sessions.
