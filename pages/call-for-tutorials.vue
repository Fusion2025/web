          The organizing committee of the 28th International Conference on
          Information Fusion is inviting the submission of proposals for
          tutorials to be presented on a date to be determined. The main purpose
          of the tutorial program is to provide overviews of the state of the
          art in the particular subfields of information fusion. This program
          should be useful to newcomers to the information fusion community to
          learn about the research achievements of the particular areas, as well
          as to currently active information fusion researchers who may be
          interested in widening their areas of research interest.

          for Papers (theory and representation, algorithms, modeling simulation
          and evaluation and applications), as well as other areas where
          information fusion can or should be applicable. Examples include but
          are not limited to fusion of human-produced and unstructured
          information, big data analytics, information fusion in cloud
          computing, information fusion applied to cybersecurity, as well as
          artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions to those.

          The honorarium for tutorial speakers is made up of a basic amount plus
          a variable bonus. However, we will not offer any printing services and
          are not responsible for study materials distributed to the attendees.
          The bonus is directly taken from the tutorial fees and thus
          proportional to the number of attendees.
