          As is tradition at Fusion Conference, we will be holding a 5K Run for
          all our attendees!
        </p>
        <p class="page-content pt-4">
          The 5K will take place at Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, a wonderful spot
          where Cariocas (the people of Rio de Janeiro) love to exercise and
          enjoy outdoor activities. With stunning views all around, you’ll get
          to run in the heart of the Marvelous City!
        </p>
        <p class="page-content pt-4">
          We will meet in front of Othon Hotel, where Fusion is located. At 7:00
          AM on 10th of July, we'll walk together to the starting line at Lagoa
          Rodrigo de Freitas — a 20 minute walk through the charming streets of
          Copacabana.
        </p>
        <p class="page-content pt-4">
          The turning point of the race will be in front of Flamengo, Rio's most
          famous sports club, well known for its football and rowing teams. The
          finish line will be in the same place we started, marking the end of
          our 5K journey.

            Hydrate: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your run.
          </li>
          <li class="pt-4">
            Warm-up: Take a few minutes to stretch and warm up your muscles
            beforehand.
          </li>
          <li class="pt-4">
            Pace yourself: Run at a comfortable pace — it's not a competition,
            it's a celebration!

          <li class="pt-4">
            Listen to your body: If you need to slow down or walk, that's
            perfectly fine. Your health and well-being come first.
