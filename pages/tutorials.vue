These tutorials will introduce participants to Stone Soup's basic components and how they fit together. They are delivered by way of demonstrations, set tasks and interactive tutorials where participants will be encouraged to write and modify algorithms. These tasks will be written up in the form of interactive browser-based applications which combine the ability to run code with a presentation environment suitable for instruction.",

These applications pose new theoretical and methodological challenges to information fusion due to heterogeneous sensors. Processing measurements is often complicated by uncertainties beyond Gaussian noise like missed detections and clutter, an uncertain origin of measurements, and an unknown and time-varying number of objects to be localized or tracked.",
      "Methodologically, these challenges can be well addressed by inference that leverages graphical models. The graph-based inference approach has important advantages regarding performance, scalability, versatility, and implementation flexibility. It provides a powerful theoretical framework and a rich set of tools for modeling and exploiting the statistical structure of an inference problem. An inherent advantage of graph-based inference is that it can provide scalable solutions to high-dimensional problems. It also introduces lucidity and modularity into algorithm design since different functional units of the overall problem appear as distinct parts in the graph. Due to these desirable properties, new graph-based modeling and inference techniques are advancing the field of localization and tracking.",

    abstract: [
      'The increasing trend towards connected sensors ("internet of things" and "ubiquitous computing") derive a demand for powerful distributed estimation methodologies. In tracking applications, the "Distributed Kalman Filter" (DKF) provides an optimal solution under certain conditions. The optimal solution in terms of the estimation accuracy is also achieved by a centralized fusion algorithm which receives either all associated measurements or so-called "tracklets". However, this scheme needs the result of each update step for the optimal solution whereas the DKF works at arbitrary communication rates since the calculation is completely distributed. Two more recent methodologies are based on the "Accumulated State Densities" (ASD) which augment the states from multiple time instants. In practical applications, tracklet fusion based on the equivalent measurement often achieves reliable results even if full communication is not available. The limitations and robustness of the tracklet fusion will be discussed.',

In particular, algorithms will be provided for each presented solution. The list of topics includes: Short introduction to target tracking, Tracklet Fusion, Exact Fusion with cross-covariances, Naive Fusion, Federated Fusion, Decentralized Fusion (Consensus Kalman Filter), Distributed Kalman Filter (DKF), Debiasing for the DKF, Distributed ASD Fusion, Augmented State Tracklet Fusion.",

Although the link between mathematical statistics and quantum physics has long been known, the potential of physics-inspired algorithms for data fusion has just begun to be realized. While the implementation of quantum algorithms is to be considered on classical as well as on quantum computers, the latter are anticipated as well- adapted "analog computers" for unprecedentedly fast solving data fusion and resources management problems. While the development of quantum computers cannot be taken for granted, their potential is nonetheless real and has to be considered by the international information fusion community.',

      "Exact solutions of many problems in tracking have high computational complexity and are impractical for all but the smallest of problems. Practical implementations entail approximation. There is a bewildering variety of established trackers available and practicing engineers and/or researchers often study them almost in isolation of each other without fully understanding what these trackers are about and how they are inter-related. One reason for this is that these filters have different combinatorial problems which are approached by explicitly enumerating the feasible solutions. The enumeration is usually a highly detailed, hard to understand accounting scheme specific to the filter and the details cloud understanding the filter and make it hard to compare different filters. On the other hand, the analytic combinatoric approach presented in this tutorial avoids the heavy accounting burden and provides a solid tool to work with. This tool is the derivative of multivariate calculus, which all engineers easily understand.",
      "This tutorial is designed to facilitate understanding of the classical theory of Analytic Combinatorics (AC) and how to apply it to problems in multi-object tracking. AC is an economical technique for encoding combinatorial problems‚Äîwithout information loss‚Äîinto the derivatives of a generating function (GF). Exact Bayesian filters derived from the GF avoid the heavy accounting burden required by traditional enumeration methods. Although AC is an established mathematical field, it is not widely known in either the academic engineering community or the practicing data fusion/tracking community. This tutorial lays the groundwork for understanding the methods of AC, starting with the GF for the classical Bayes-Markov filter. From this cornerstone, we derive many established filters (e.g., PDA, JPDA, JIPDA, PHD, CPHD, MultiBernoulli, MHT) with simplicity, economy, and insight. We also show how to use the saddle point method (method of stationary phase) to find low complexity approximations of probability distributions and summary statistics.",

The concept will be demonstrated by examples.",
      "- Sensor control for a reactive target: Sensor control is active or plan-ahead sensing, where sensing and Bayesian estimation are conducted sequentially in a closed loop. Sensor control is typically formulated as partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), where the reward is defined in the form of information gain. The main limitation of this paradigm is that it assumes that the target is non-reactive, that is, it does not change its behavior as a consequence of being observed. This tutorial will introduce game theory, as a mathematical framework for studying interactions between intelligent players, in the context of sensor control for a reactive target.",
      "- Formulation of target tracking in the framework of possibility theory: Traditional target tracking algorithms are formulated in the framework of Bayesian probability theory. The main limitation of the traditional approach is that probabilistic models of target dynamics and sensor measurements need top be known precisely. When probabilistic models are known only partially, possibility theory provides an alternative approach. The tutorial will formulate Bayesian-like possibilistic tracking algorithms and demonstrate their performance.",

This tutorial will provide an opportunity for students and researchers to learn about fundamental and advanced aspects of the multi-source (either sensors or humans) information fusion within the theory of belief functions. Rather than surveying the different combination rules, this tutorial will specifically address the problem of combining information from partially reliable sources, explaining how to properly use meta-knowledge about the sources reliability in the fusion process. A general approach to information fusion will be presented, allowing for various forms of the notion of reliability and reinforcing the relevance of belief function theory for information fusion. Means to tackle practical fusion problems will also be provided. When meta-knowledge about the source reliability is not available, the validity of assumptions on the source reliability can be evaluated thanks to the notion of consistency which provides an estimation of the credibility of information. One interpretation of the conflict (or lack of consistency) between sources is indeed that it is due to the unreliability of some of the sources involved in the reasoning. The second part of the tutorial will present a survey and recent advances on both unary and N-ary measures of uncertainty with belief functions. A general presentation of entropy measures will be provided, extending to cross-entropy, conflict and distance measures, highlighting links, similarities and differences between them. These measures enable us to quantify notions of informativeness, specificity, accuracy, to name a few. Each theoretical concept will be illustrated by running examples from several applications.",
