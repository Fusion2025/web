        The Fusion Technical and Social Program will be crafted by our Program
        Committee Chairs once all the required information is available in its
        final form. This includes the final lists of accepted papers and others
        that happen at the end of the remote phase of the technical program in
        late May. We expect the final program to be available on or before
        mid-June. In the meantime, we will be updating the information in this
        page as the preparation steps are finalized.
