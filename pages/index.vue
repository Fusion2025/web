          Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will host the 28th ISIF Fusion Conference from
          July 7-11, 2025, the first ever in South America. Rio de Janeiro never
          fails to impress with its modern outlook that reflects its progression
          through the times of yore. The historic sites, sparkling beaches,
          green belts and cheerful attitude of the locals attract tourists where
          heaven meets earth. If Ronaldo played football at the Maracanã
          stadium, then Christ the Redeemer put Rio on the world map. Rio's
          carnival, with its energetic samba dancers jiggling their hips,
          attracts thousands of tourists from around the world. The
          rain-forests, museums, beaches, gardens and the glitz of the city have
          made Rio what it is today Brazil's top-notch tourist destination.

        <p class="page-content pt-4">
          The venue is at the center of the touristic zone of Rio de Janeiro in
          front of some of the most famous beaches - Copacabana. It provides
          excellent facilities, first-rate service levels, and all the
          additional amenities expected in major hotels, including easy access
          to various attractions - such as the Sugar Loaf, Christ the Redeemer,
          beaches and so much more.
        </p>
        <p class="page-content pt-4">
          In addition to the numerous attractions and activities located in the
          South Zone of Rio, Rio has much more to offer. From the pitoresc
          neighborhoods of Santa Teresa to Maracanã Stadium, from Gigoia Island
          to beautiful art museums, from Samba Schools to Lapa passing through
          the Royal Gabinet of Literature (one of the most beautiful libraries
          in the world) and the beaches of Barra da Tijuca.
